# 🐶 RelAppmidos  
*Because some doggos just can’t stop slurping…*  

RelAppmidos is a playful **GTA-style slurp tracker** inspired by my own dog, Sasha, who’s obsessed with licking people’s faces.  
What started as a fun experiment turned into a project where I began exploring **front-end development**. Another of Sasha's victims kindly provided me with a **backend (API + authentication + captcha)** to handle real user data.

## Features  

- 🎮 **Game-like vibe** → A retro, GTA-inspired interface to make slurp-tracking fun  
- 👤 **User authentication** → Real login system (yes, even my cat has an account 🐱)  
- 🔒 **Captcha validation** → Prevents bots from flooding the registration process  
- 📝 **Registration page** → Anyone can create their own account and check our scores  
- 🐈 **Guest mode** → If you don't feel like creating an account, you can still add slurps to Pixie the cat (score won't be recorded)  
- 📊 **Slurp counter** → Track and record slurps per session  
- 💬 **Interactive UI** → Alerts, validations, and playful touches everywhere

## What I learned  

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: created a responsive slurp counter where users click/tap on defined zones of the image to add points. Added visual feedback on touch/click, implemented a full registration system with captcha validation, password rules, and custom modals/dialog overlays, with ARIA attributes and accessibility considerations for better UX.
- **Front-end UX & interactivity**: designed alerts, pop-ups, and smooth interactions that make the game feel playful and responsive.  
- **Modern CSS features**: explored `:has()`, `:not()`, CSS nesting, `clamp()`, `aspect-ratio`, `dvh` units, smooth scrolling, and keyframe animations to build a fully responsive and dynamic UI.  
- **Creativity meets functionality**: combined game-inspired visuals, responsive layouts, and subtle animations to enhance user engagement.  
- **Real-world app thinking**: considered authentication, captcha integration, and frontend-backend coordination.

## Extra Fun 🐾  

- The app supports **multiple characters** (my dog, my cat… and if you're logged in, you can request your avatar – the app can access your device front camera).  
- Includes a cheeky **“Slurp Agreement”** checkbox you can *try* to uncheck… (good luck 😏)  
- Built with love, humor, and approved by Sasha.

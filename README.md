## Project Description
A fun and interactive web app that tracks dogs' daily slurps and licks on their owner's face. Inspired by Sasha, my lively pitbull, who proved that pitbulls can be as affectionate as anyone with her famous “lick attacks.” This app showcases front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a playful GTA comic style.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## Features
- Tracks daily lick/slurp count with simple button controls.  
- Allows user avatar selection for personalization.  
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes.  

## Important Note
The live demo is currently disabled to manage backend resource costs, but this repository contains the full front-end code for the app.
